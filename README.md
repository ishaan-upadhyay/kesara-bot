# Kesara

Kesara is a multipurpose Discord bot primarily featuring Last.fm, quotes and music cataloguing functionality for personal usage, written in Python. It is designed to be self-hosted on a device such as a Raspberry Pi. 

## Usage
The default prefix for Kesara is ';' but you can easily alter it for your own server using inbuilt commands. 

## Prerequisites
- Python >= 3.9
- PostgreSQL
- 'discord.py'
- 'pygicord'
- 'tekore'
- 'asyncpg'

## Credits
The Last.fm cog is entirely credited to joinemm, developer of Miso Bot. There are only slight tweaks to the code, and it is primarily used for underlying functionality in the catalogue (checking if a user has finished listening to recommended items).
